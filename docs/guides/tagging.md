# Tagging

This doc explains how to tag an asset in Compass with a specific tag.

## Tag Template
To support reusability of a tag, Compass has a tag template that we need to define first before we apply it to an asset. Tagging an asset means Compass will wire tag template to assets.

Creating a tag template could be done with Tag Template API.


TODO complete this docs once the tag template is already using `asset id`
