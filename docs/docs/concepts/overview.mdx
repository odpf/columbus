# Overview

Compass has three major concept when it comes to data ingestion: Asset, Type, and Service.

Asset is the main model that represents a metadata of a specific service with a specific type.

Type defines a ‘type’ of an asset and it is pre-defined. Compass currently supports the following types:
1. `table`
2. `job`
3. `dashboard`
4. `topic`
5. `feature_table`
6. `model` (under development)
7. `application` (under development)
 
Service defines the application or source that maintains or generates the asset. Examples would be `biquery`, `postgres`, etc.

Some features that compass has:
* [Discovery](../tour/2-querying-assets.mdx)
* [Lineage](../tour/3-asset-lineage.mdx)
* [Asset Tagging](./asset#tagging-an-asset)
* [User](./user.md)
* [Discussion](../guides/discussion.md)
* [Starring](../guides/starring.md)

## Discussion
Compass supports discussion feature. User could drop comments in each discussion. Currently, there are three types of discussions `issues`, `open ended`, and `question and answer`. Depending on the type, the discussion could have multiple possible states. In the current version, all types only have two states: `open` and `closed`. A newly created discussion will always be assign an `open` state. More detail about [Discussion](../guides/discussion.md).

## Starring
Compass allows a user to stars an asset. This bookmarking functionality is introduced to increase the speed of a user to get information. There is also an API to see which users star an asset (stargazers). More detail about [Starring](../guides/starring.md).
