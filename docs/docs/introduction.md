# Introduction

Welcome to the introductory guide to Compass! This guide is the best place to start with Compass. We cover what Compass is, what problems it can solve, how it works, and how you can get started using it. If you are familiar with the basics of Compass, the guide provides a more detailed reference of available features.

## What is Compass?

Compass is a search and discovery engine built for querying application deployments, datasets and meta resources. It can also optionally track data flow relationships between these resources and allow the user to view a representation of the data flow graph.

## The problem we aim to solve

Organizational teams face the challenge of finding the right data from various sources for their analysis and decision-making needs. A lack of transparency about the flow of data within the organization can lead to problems when it comes to updating or discarding outdated data.

Manual methods for tracking the dependencies of data are time-consuming and subject to human error or oversight as it depends on mapping of the movement of data in the organisation on knowledge in people's head. Huge code volume, rate of change and complexity in manually examinig the data changes make the process unsustainable. In addition, fixing a breaking change in production is more expensive and critical than identifying it in implementation phase. 
Additionally, organizations may struggle to locate the most relevant data from the massive amounts stored in their data stores. The longer it takes for users to find the business data they need, the less productive they are.

To address these challenges, Compass was designed as a data discovery and search tool for organizations. It provides comprehensive asset-listing and search capabilities to enhance user productivity. Organizing the data assets using Compass allows the data professionals to collect, access, and enrich metadata to support data discovery and governance. The data lineage information provided by Compass also helps organizations meet compliance requirements by offering a clear record of the movement of sensitive data. Identify and star the most important data asset using Compass, and safely delete when you donâ€™t need.

## How does it work?

## Key Features

Discover why users choose Compass as their main data discovery and lineage service

- **Full text search** Faster and better search results powered by ElasticSearch full text search capability.
- **Search Tuning** Narrow down your search results by adding filters, getting your crisp results.
- **Data Lineage** Understand the relationship between metadata with data lineage interface.
- **Scale:** Compass scales in an instant, both vertically and horizontally for high performance.
- **Extensibility:** Add your own metadata types and resources to support wide variety of metadata.
- **Runtime:** Compass can run inside VMs or containers in a fully managed runtime environment like kubernetes.

## Usage

Explore the following resources to get started with Compass:

- [Guides](./guides/ingestion) provides guidance on ingesting and queying metadata from Compass.
- [Concepts](./concepts/overview) describes all important Compass concepts.
- [Reference](./reference/configuration.md) contains details about configurations, metrics and other aspects of Compass.
- [Contribute](./contribute/contributing.md) contains resources for anyone who wants to contribute to Compass.

## Using Compass
### Compass Command Line Interface

For more information on using the Compass CLI, see the CLI Reference page.

### HTTPS API

For more information, see the API reference page.

## Where to go from here

See the [installation](./installation) page to install the Compass CLI. Next, we recommend completing the guides. The tour provides an overview of most of the existing functionality of Compass and takes approximately 20 minutes to complete.

After completing the tour, check out the remainder of the documentation in the reference and concepts sections for your specific areas of interest. We've aimed to provide as much documentation as we can for the various components of Compass to give you a full understanding of Compass's surface area.

Finally, follow the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/odpf/compass), and contact us if you'd like to get involved.
